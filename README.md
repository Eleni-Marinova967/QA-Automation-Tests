# 🚀 QA Automation Tests with Cypress  

This repository contains **Cypress automation tests** for web application testing.  
The project is a **work in progress**, as I am actively learning and developing my skills in test automation.

## 🌱 About This Project  
I started learning **Cypress** two months ago, and this project is my personal practice to improve my automation skills.  
Although the project is in its **early stages**, I am constantly improving and expanding it.  

✔ Covers **promo code creation tests** with different user roles.  
✔ Uses **best practices** such as **Page Object Model** and environment variables.  
✔ Ensures **test data security** (no credentials stored in the repository).  

I am **highly motivated** to continue learning and developing this project further! 🚀
